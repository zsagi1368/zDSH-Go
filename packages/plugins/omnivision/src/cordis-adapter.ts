/**
 * Cordis adapter shell for bundle-direct mounting (zDSH-go web profile).
 *
 * The upstream factory (`createOmnivisionPlugin`) targets the DSH harness
 * PluginContext and is not a cordis plugin, while the bundle path mounts this
 * package straight from a loader entry (`name: dsh-omnivision`): the loader
 * unwraps the module namespace and hands it to the cordis registry, which only
 * accepts a function or an object with an `apply` method. The independent
 * upstream repo ships that handshake in its installer; in zDSH-go the shell
 * lives here instead.
 *
 * Contract — identical to the other zDSH-go mounted plugins (plugin-center
 * shell, filehub, webstack, autopilot): named `name`/`inject`/`apply` exports,
 * no default required (the loader falls back to the namespace object, whose
 * `apply` the registry resolves).
 *
 * No cordis imports on purpose: this package must keep building standalone
 * (cordis is not in its dependency graph), so the host context is typed
 * structurally and every seam is optional.
